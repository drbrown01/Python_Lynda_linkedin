Ok, wow. This is all coming back to me...

So here is a snapshot of what I am doing with this. Overall, my plan is to redo Python and do .net for the first time.

So far, .net and VS Code has been very cool! It reminds me of the Python Django flow but WAY easier.

Excited to see how that goes in future projects.

Today, it is a Git setup and remember how to add, commit and push. Branch, clone, etc..

Going to put this in now and see how I do! Talk to you on the next file.
